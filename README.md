# FrameTrail
## Open Hypervideo Environment

### Create, Annotate & Remix Interactive Videos

## Overview

FrameTrail let's you experience, manage & edit non-linear interactive video in a simple and extendable online environment. FrameTrail can be easily customized for different purposes and view modes. Our aim is to allow authors the creation of open timebased media formats, which make full use of current web technology and support the remix culture that the web is built on.

## Features

* Latest Versions of Chrome and Firefox
* Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge if you're lucky (not tested)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* **Apache** Web Server (2.2.29 +) with **PHP** (5.6.2 +)

(any other configuration might also be fine, but this one has been tested)

Please note that you can use FrameTrail "read-only" locally without any server, as long as your browser supports local Ajax requests (there are known issues with Chrome, but Firefox should work in most cases). Of course you won't be able to use the editing features.

### Setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/OpenHypervideo/FrameTrail` or **Download ZIP** to your **server directory** (i.e. `http://example.com/DIRECTORY-NAME` or `http://localhost/DIRECTORY-NAME` if you're using XAMMP, MAMP etc. for a local setup).
2. Open your **server directory** in your favourite browser.
3. Follow the instructions to define an administrator account and configure your FrameTrail instance.
